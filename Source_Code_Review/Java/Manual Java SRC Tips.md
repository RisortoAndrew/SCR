### 1. **SQL Injection**

Java code that handles database queries through vulnerable methods like `Statement` or unsanitized queries can lead to SQL Injection. Look for areas where raw user input is passed into SQL queries without proper validation or parameterization.

**Regex for SQL Injection:**
```regex
Statement\s+.*execute(Query|Update)\s*\(.*(getParameter|request|getInputStream|getQueryString|BufferedReader)
```
- **Explanation**: This searches for places where the `Statement` object is used with user input (`getParameter`, `request`) to build SQL queries. These areas are at risk for SQL injection.

```regex
"(SELECT|UPDATE|DELETE|INSERT).*"[\s\S]*\+[\s\S]*(getParameter|getQueryString|request)
```
- **Explanation**: This searches for string concatenation in SQL statements where user input is used directly, a typical sign of SQL Injection risk.

### 2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

In Java web applications, XSS vulnerabilities occur when user inputs are rendered in the output HTML without proper encoding.

**Regex for XSS Vulnerabilities:**
```regex
response\.getWriter\(\)\.write\((.*(getParameter|getQueryString|getCookies|request))\)
```
- **Explanation**: This searches for places where raw user input is written directly to the response, which could be a vector for reflected XSS.

```regex
out\.print\((.*(getParameter|getQueryString|getCookies|request))\)
```
- **Explanation**: Identifies output functions like `out.print()` where user input may be injected into the HTML directly.

### 3. **Command Injection**

Command injection occurs when user-controlled input is passed into system command execution functions.

**Regex for Command Injection:**
```regex
(Runtime|ProcessBuilder)\.exec\((.*(getParameter|getQueryString|request|getInputStream))
```
- **Explanation**: This looks for potentially unsafe use of `Runtime.exec()` or `ProcessBuilder.exec()` where user input is being passed directly into the command execution, leading to a command injection risk.

### 4. **Insecure File Handling**

File handling in Java can lead to serious security issues, such as Path Traversal and arbitrary file read/write vulnerabilities.

**Regex for Insecure File Access:**
```regex
new\s+File\s*\(.*(getParameter|getQueryString|request|getInputStream)\)
```
- **Explanation**: This searches for file creation or access with user-controlled input, potentially leading to directory traversal or other file-related attacks.

```regex
(FileInputStream|FileOutputStream|FileReader|FileWriter)\s*\(.*(getParameter|getQueryString|request|getInputStream)
```
- **Explanation**: Searches for file operations like reading or writing using user input, which can allow an attacker to manipulate file paths and compromise the file system.

### 5. **Insecure Deserialization**

Java deserialization vulnerabilities can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if untrusted data is deserialized without validation.

**Regex for Insecure Deserialization:**
```regex
ObjectInputStream\s+.*new\s+ObjectInputStream\s*\(.*(getParameter|getQueryString|request|getInputStream)
```
- **Explanation**: This pattern searches for insecure deserialization points, where user input is passed directly into an `ObjectInputStream` without proper validation.

### 6. **Hardcoded Credentials and Sensitive Data**

Hardcoding sensitive data like passwords, API keys, and secrets in Java code is a common security oversight.

**Regex for Hardcoded Credentials:**
```regex
(password|pwd|passwd|secret|api_key|token|authorization)[\s]*=[\s]*["'][^"']*["']
```
- **Explanation**: Identifies hardcoded credentials (passwords, API keys, secrets) that could be easily extracted and used for attacks.

### 7. **Insecure Use of Cryptography**

Improper use of cryptographic functions in Java can weaken security. Look for weak algorithms and insecure practices.

**Regex for Insecure Cryptography:**
```regex
Cipher\s+.*getInstance\s*\(\s*["'](AES|DES|RSA|RC4)["']\s*\)
```
- **Explanation**: This searches for the use of cryptographic functions where weak or outdated algorithms (like `DES`, `RC4`) are used. `AES` should be checked for proper usage (e.g., mode and padding).

```regex
MessageDigest\s+.*getInstance\s*\(\s*["'](MD5|SHA1)["']\s*\)
```
- **Explanation**: Searches for instances where weak hashing algorithms like `MD5` and `SHA-1` are being used. These algorithms are considered insecure and should be replaced with stronger algorithms like `SHA-256`.

### 8. **Improper Session Management**

Poor session management can lead to session hijacking or fixation attacks.

**Regex for Improper Session Handling:**
```regex
request\.getSession\s*\(.*\)\.setAttribute\s*\(.*(password|token|user)
```
- **Explanation**: Searches for improper session handling where sensitive information is stored in the session without encryption or other protective measures.

```regex
request\.getSession\s*\(.*true\)
```
- **Explanation**: This looks for session fixation vulnerabilities where the `getSession(true)` is used without regenerating the session ID after authentication.

### 9. **Logging of Sensitive Information**

Sensitive data (passwords, tokens, etc.) should never be logged.

**Regex for Sensitive Data in Logs:**
```regex
(log\.|logger\.)\s*(info|debug|warn|error)\s*\(.*(password|token|secret|api_key|authorization)
```
- **Explanation**: This searches for places where sensitive information is logged, which could leak confidential data in log files.

### 10. **Missing Input Validation**

Java code that directly uses user input without validation can be vulnerable to a wide variety of attacks (XSS, SQLi, etc.).

**Regex for Missing Input Validation:**
```regex
(getParameter|getQueryString|request)\s*\(.*\)
```
- **Explanation**: This finds places where user input is being fetched but not validated or sanitized, which could lead to vulnerabilities if the input is later used in SQL queries, HTML output, or file handling.
