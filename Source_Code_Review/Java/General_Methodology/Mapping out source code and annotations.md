### Mapping Out a Code Base for Source Code Review

1. **Understand the Project Structure:**
   - Look at the project structure, typically following the Maven or Gradle directory conventions (`src/main/java`, `src/main/resources`, etc.).
   - Identify key packages and classes and understand their roles. For instance, `controllers` often manage HTTP requests, `services` handle business logic, and `repositories` interact with the database.

2. **Identify Entry Points:**
   - Find the main class (`public static void main(String[] args)`) where the application starts.
   - In Spring, look for classes annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` or `@Configuration` that bootstrap the application.
   - Map out how the application starts and initializes. Pay attention to beans or configurations that are loaded early.

3. **Trace HTTP Request Flow:**
   - For web applications, map out controllers and their endpoints (`@RestController` or `@Controller`). Note the URL mappings (`@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping`, etc.).
   - Identify request parameters, path variables, and request bodies and understand how data flows from HTTP requests into the application.
   - Trace how data is processed through service layers and reaches the data access layer.

4. **Map Out Dependency Injection:**
   - Identify where dependencies are injected using `@Autowired`, `@Inject`, or constructors.
   - Understand the lifecycle and scope of beans (`@Singleton`, `@RequestScope`, `@SessionScope`, etc.).
   - Check configuration files (`application.properties`, `application.yml`) and understand how they affect the bean lifecycle and injection.

5. **Focus on Security-Sensitive Areas:**
   - Identify classes handling authentication and authorization (e.g., `@PreAuthorize`, `@Secured`, `@RolesAllowed`).
   - Review data validation logic (e.g., `@Valid`, `@NotNull`) to ensure user inputs are correctly validated.
   - Trace the flow of sensitive data, such as passwords and tokens, to ensure they are not logged or exposed.

6. **Database Interactions:**
   - Identify repositories or DAO classes (typically `@Repository` or interfaces extending `JpaRepository`).
   - Map out how data is queried, updated, or deleted and validate that queries are parameterized to avoid SQL injection.
   - Review entity classes (`@Entity`) and their relationships (`@OneToOne`, `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, `@ManyToMany`).

7. **Identify Configuration Classes:**
   - Look for classes annotated with `@Configuration`, `@Bean`, `@Component`, and custom configuration files.
   - Understand how third-party integrations (e.g., databases, messaging systems) are configured and used.

8. **Look for Custom Annotations:**
   - Identify any custom annotations and review their definitions.
   - Understand how they are being used throughout the code base and what behaviors they enforce or modify.

9. **Map Utility Classes and Helpers:**
   - Identify helper classes that provide common utilities like logging, exception handling, or HTTP client requests.
   - Review the logic of utility methods and their impact on other parts of the code.
