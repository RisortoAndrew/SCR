## **1. Introduction to File Upload Vulnerabilities**

### **1.1. Overview of File Upload Functionality**

File upload functionality enables users to transfer files from their local systems to a server. However, it introduces risks, such as remote code execution (RCE), file overwrite attacks, and directory traversal, among others.

### **1.2. Common File Upload Vulnerabilities**

- **RCE:** Execution of malicious code uploaded as a file.
- **DoS:** Server resource consumption through large file uploads.
- **Unrestricted File Uploads:** Accepting files without validation.
- **Directory Traversal:** Accessing unintended files via path manipulation.
- **Insecure Storage:** Publicly accessible file storage without proper access control.

### **1.3. Causes of Vulnerabilities**

Common causes include lack of file content validation, insufficient access controls, unsanitized file paths, and insecure file handling practices.

## **2. Common Vulnerable Patterns in Python Applications**

File upload vulnerabilities often emerge when files are processed or stored insecurely.

### **2.1. Accepting Files Without Validation**

- No MIME type or extension checks.
- No content inspection (e.g., allowing arbitrary files).

### **2.2. Insecure File Storage**

- Files stored in web-accessible directories.
- Files saved without unique identifiers, enabling overwrites.

### **2.3. Unsanitized File Names**

- Using original, user-provided file names.
- Allowing paths like `../` to enable directory traversal.

### **2.4. No File Size Restrictions**

- No size limit on uploaded files, allowing DoS attacks.

### **2.5. Lack of Secure Temporary File Handling**

- Temporary files stored in insecure locations with inadequate permissions.

## **3. Regex Patterns and Manual Detection Methods**

### **3.1. Identifying File Upload Handling Code**

**Pattern:**

```python
from\s+werkzeug\.utils\s+import\s+secure_filename
from\s+flask\s+import\s+request
```

**Explanation:**
- Detects imports often used for handling file uploads in Flask, a popular web framework in Python.

### **3.2. Detecting File Retrieval from Requests**

**Pattern:**

```python
request\.files\[\s*['"]\w+['"]\s*\]
```

**Explanation:**
- Finds where files are retrieved from the request. Check how retrieved files are processed.

### **3.3. Searching for Insecure File Storage**

**Pattern:**

```python
open\s*\(\s*os\.path\.join\s*\(\s*['"].*['"],\s*file\.filename\s*\)\s*,\s*['"]wb?['"]\)
```

**Explanation:**
- Identifies code that saves uploaded files directly to the filesystem. Review the file path to ensure it doesnâ€™t store files in web-accessible locations.

### **3.4. Detecting Use of Original File Names**

**Pattern:**

```python
file_name\s*=\s*file\.filename
```

**Explanation:**
- Finds where the original filename from the user is directly used. Check if the filename is sanitized before being stored.

### **3.5. Checking for Lack of File Type Validation**

**Pattern:**
- Absence of checks for file type or extension.

**Manual Method:**
- Check if there is validation for MIME types or extensions (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`).

### **3.6. Identifying Missing File Size Restrictions**

**Pattern:**
- Absence of file size restrictions.

**Manual Method:**
- Verify if file size limits are applied (e.g., `file.size < MAX_SIZE`).

### **3.7. Detecting Unsanitized File Names**

**Pattern:**

```python
file_name\s*=\s*request\.files\['\w+'\]\.filename
```

**Explanation:**
- Identifies where user-provided file names are stored. Check if `secure_filename` from `werkzeug.utils` or similar sanitization is applied.

### **3.8. Identifying Insecure Temporary File Handling**

**Pattern:**

```python
tempfile\.NamedTemporaryFile\(\s*.*\)
```

**Explanation:**
- Finds temporary file creation. Check if secure permissions are set.

## **4. Detailed Examples and Explanations**

### **4.1. Vulnerable Code Example: Accepting Files Without Validation**

```python
file = request.files['file']
file.save(os.path.join('/uploads', file.filename))
```

**Why It's Vulnerable:**
- No file type validation or sanitization of `file.filename`.
- Attack Potential: Malicious code uploaded as a script or executable.

**Regex Explanation:**
- Identifies usage of `request.files` and insecure `file.save` without validation.

### **4.2. Vulnerable Code Example: Storing Files in Web-Accessible Directory**

```python
@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload():
    file = request.files['file']
    file.save(os.path.join(app.root_path, 'static/uploads', file.filename))
```

**Why It's Vulnerable:**
- Saves files in a web-accessible directory, `static/uploads`.
- Attack Potential: Arbitrary file retrieval and potential RCE.

**Regex Explanation:**
- Detects `os.path.join` combined with a directory path in `static`.

### **4.3. Vulnerable Code Example: Unsanitized File Names**

```python
@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload():
    file = request.files['file']
    file.save(os.path.join('/var/uploads/', file.filename))
```

**Why It's Vulnerable:**
- Uses user-provided `file.filename`, allowing directory traversal via `../`.
- Attack Potential: Critical file overwrite or data leakage.

**Regex Explanation:**
- Finds usage of `file.filename` without sanitization in the file path.

## **5. Interpreting and Validating Findings**

**1.** **Assess File Processing Logic:**
   - Determine if the application restricts file types or sanitizes file names.
  
**2.** **Check File Storage Paths:**
   - Review the file storage path to confirm it is not web-accessible.

**3.** **Evaluate File Size Constraints:**
   - Ensure file size restrictions are implemented to avoid DoS risks.

**4.** **Consider Abuse Cases:**
   - Assess potential attacker scenarios, such as uploading scripts or large files.

## **6. Best Practices for Prevention**

### **6.1. Validate File Type and Content**

**Example Code:**

```python
allowed_extensions = {'png', 'jpg', 'jpeg'}
if file.filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1].lower() not in allowed_extensions:
    abort(400, "Invalid file type")
```

### **6.2. Sanitize File Names**

**Example Code:**

```python
from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename
filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
```

### **6.3. Limit File Size**

- Set a size limit in configuration or validate on upload:

```python
if file.content_length > MAX_FILE_SIZE:
    abort(400, "File too large")
```

### **6.4. Store Files Securely**

- Save files outside of web-accessible directories, e.g., `UPLOAD_FOLDER = '/secure_folder/'`.
