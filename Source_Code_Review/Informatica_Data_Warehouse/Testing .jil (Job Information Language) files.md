## **1. Understanding Autosys `.jil` Files**

Autosys Job Information Language (`.jil`) files are used to define and configure jobs in the Autosys job scheduling system. These files specify job attributes such as command lines, environment variables, execution users, and dependencies. Misconfigurations or insecure practices within these files can lead to security vulnerabilities, including command injection, privilege escalation, and unauthorized access.

## **2. Job Definitions**

### **2.1 Command Lines**

#### **2.1.1 Potential Injection Vulnerabilities**

**Command injection** occurs when untrusted input is incorporated into command lines without proper validation or sanitization. In the context of Autosys `.jil` files, this can happen if variables or parameters are used unsafely within the `command` attribute.

**Risks include:**

- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Attackers may execute unintended commands.
- **Data Exposure or Loss:** Sensitive information may be accessed or destroyed.
- **System Compromise:** Unauthorized control over system processes.

#### **2.1.2 Regex Patterns for Detection**

To identify potential injection vulnerabilities in the `command` attribute, use the following regex patterns in VS Code's search functionality.

---

**a. Detecting Usage of Unescaped Variables in Commands**

```regex
^\s*command:\s.*\$[{\(]?\w+[^}\)]?[^\\]*$
```

**Explanation:**

- `^\s*command:\s`: Matches lines starting with `command:` (ignoring leading whitespace).
- `.*`: Matches any characters after `command:`.
- `\$[{\(]?\w+[^}\)]?`: Matches variables like `$VAR`, `${VAR}`, `$(VAR)`.
- `[^\\]*$`: Ensures the line does not end with a backslash (line continuation).

**Instructions:**

- **Disable "Match Case":** Ensure that the **"Match Case"** option is **unchecked** in VS Code's search panel to perform a case-insensitive search.
- **Enable Regex Search:** Click on the `.*` icon to enable regex search.

**Example Matches:**

- `command: ls $UNTRUSTED_INPUT`
- `command: rm -rf ${UNSAFE_VAR}`
- `command: cp $(MALICIOUS_VAR) /safe/dir`

---

**b. Detecting Commands Containing Suspicious Characters**

```regex
^\s*command:\s.*[;&|`].*$
```

**Explanation:**

- Matches lines where the `command` attribute contains characters like `;`, `&`, `|`, or backticks `` ` ``, which may indicate command chaining or injection attempts.

**Instructions:**

- **Disable "Match Case"** and **Enable Regex Search** as above.

**Example Matches:**

- `command: echo $VAR; rm -rf /`
- `command: cat /etc/passwd | grep root`
- ``command: `malicious_command` ``

---

**c. Detecting Use of `eval` or Risky Functions**

```regex
^\s*command:\s.*\b(eval|system|exec)\b.*$
```

**Explanation:**

- Matches lines where the `command` includes functions like `eval`, `system`, or `exec`, which can execute commands dynamically and are risky if misused.
- `\b`: Word boundary to ensure accurate matching of the function names.

**Instructions:**

- **Disable "Match Case"** and **Enable Regex Search** as above.

**Example Matches:**

- `command: eval $DYNAMIC_COMMAND`
- `command: system("rm -rf /")`

---

### **2.2 Environment Variables**

#### **2.2.1 Securing Environment Variables**

Environment variables in job definitions should be securely set and should not expose sensitive information like passwords, tokens, or credentials.

**Risks include:**

- **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** Hard-coded secrets can be accessed by unauthorized users.
- **Injection Attacks:** Unsanitized environment variables may be exploited.

#### **2.2.2 Regex Patterns for Detection**

---

**a. Detecting Hard-coded Sensitive Information**

```regex
^\s*envvars:\s.*\b(PASS|PWD|TOKEN|SECRET|KEY)\b\s*=\s*['"]?.+['"]?.*$
```

**Explanation:**

- Matches lines where environment variables containing sensitive keywords are assigned values.
- `\b`: Word boundaries to match whole words.

**Instructions:**

- **Disable "Match Case"** and **Enable Regex Search** as above.

**Example Matches:**

- `envvars: PASSWORD="mysecretpassword"`
- `envvars: API_TOKEN=1234567890`

---

**b. Detecting Unsanitized Environment Variables in Commands**

```regex
^\s*command:\s.*\$[{\(]?(\bPASS\b|\bPWD\b|\bTOKEN\b|\bSECRET\b|\bKEY\b)[^}\)]?.*$
```

**Explanation:**

- Matches commands using sensitive environment variables directly.
- Ensures that the variable names match exactly using `\b` word boundaries.

**Instructions:**

- **Disable "Match Case"** and **Enable Regex Search** as above.

**Example Matches:**

- `command: echo $PASSWORD`
- `command: curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN"`

---

**c. Detecting Missing Environment Variable Definitions**

```regex
^\s*envvars:\s*(?!.*\b(REQUIRED_VAR1|REQUIRED_VAR2)\b).*$
```

**Explanation:**

- Matches lines where critical environment variables are **not** defined.
- Negative lookahead `(?!.*\b(REQUIRED_VAR1|REQUIRED_VAR2)\b)` ensures the variables are not present.

**Instructions:**

- **Adjust the pattern** by replacing `REQUIRED_VAR1`, `REQUIRED_VAR2` with the actual variable names you need to check.
- **Disable "Match Case"** and **Enable Regex Search** as above.

---

## **3. Permissions and Execution Context**

### **3.1 Run User**

#### **3.1.1 Least Privilege Principle**

Jobs should execute under the least privileged user necessary to perform their tasks. Running jobs as highly privileged users like `root` can lead to severe security risks if the job is compromised.

**Risks include:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers gaining higher-level system access.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Access to sensitive files or system resources.

#### **3.1.2 Regex Patterns for Detection**

---

**a. Detecting Jobs Running as Root or Privileged Users**

```regex
^\s*run_as:\s*(root|admin|administrator|superuser)\b.*$
```

**Explanation:**

- Matches lines where the `run_as` attribute is set to high-privilege users.
- `\b`: Word boundary to ensure accurate matching.

**Instructions:**

- **Disable "Match Case"** and **Enable Regex Search** as above.

**Example Matches:**

- `run_as: root`
- `run_as: administrator`

---

**b. Detecting Jobs Not Specifying `run_as` User**

```regex
^\s*insert_job:\s.*$(?:\n(?!\s*run_as:).*)*\n\s*command:
```

**Explanation:**

- Matches job definitions where `run_as` is not specified between `insert_job:` and `command:` lines.
- Uses non-capturing group `(?:...)` and negative lookahead `(?!...)` to skip lines not containing `run_as:`.

**Instructions:**

- **Enable "Use Regular Expressions":** Ensure this option is checked in VS Code's search panel.
- **Enable "Search . in single line":** In VS Code, the regex engine may not support multi-line patterns by default. You may need to adjust settings or use an extension that supports multi-line regex searches.
- **Disable "Match Case"** as above.

**Note:** If the above regex does not work due to multi-line limitations, you might need to search for jobs where `run_as` is missing by other means, such as scripting or manual review.

---

**c. Listing All Users in `run_as` Attributes**

```regex
^\s*run_as:\s*(\w+)\b.*$
```

**Explanation:**

- Captures the username specified in `run_as` attributes for review.
- `(\w+)`: Captures the username.

**Instructions:**

- **Disable "Match Case"** and **Enable Regex Search** as above.
- **Review the captured groups** to list all users.

**Example Matches:**

- `run_as: oracle`
- `run_as: etl_user`

---

### **3.2 Access Controls**

#### **3.2.1 Securing Job Definitions**

Ensure that only authorized personnel can modify `.jil` files and job definitions. Access controls should be in place to prevent unauthorized changes that could introduce vulnerabilities.

**Best Practices:**

- **File Permissions:** Set appropriate file system permissions on `.jil` files.
- **Version Control:** Use version control systems with access restrictions.
- **Audit Trails:** Maintain logs of changes to job definitions.

---

## **4. Scheduling and Dependencies**

### **4.1 Job Dependencies**

#### **4.1.1 Potential Exploits**

Job dependencies define the order and conditions under which jobs execute. Misconfigured dependencies can be exploited to:

- **Disrupt Operations:** By altering dependencies, attackers can prevent critical jobs from running.
- **Escalate Privileges:** Manipulating job triggers to execute unauthorized jobs.

#### **4.1.2 Regex Patterns for Detection**

---

**a. Detecting Jobs with Complex Dependencies**

```regex
^\s*condition:\s.*\b(s\(.*?\)|f\(.*?\)|n\(.*?\))\b.*$
```

**Explanation:**

- Matches lines where the `condition` attribute defines complex dependencies based on job status:
  - `s(job_name)`: Success of a job.
  - `f(job_name)`: Failure of a job.
  - `n(job_name)`: Not running.

**Instructions:**

- **Disable "Match Case"** and **Enable Regex Search** as above.

**Example Matches:**

- `condition: s(jobA) & f(jobB)`
- `condition: n(jobC) | s(jobD)`

---

**b. Identifying Jobs Triggered by External Events**

```regex
^\s*condition:\s.*\bevent\([^)]*\)\b.*$
```

**Explanation:**

- Matches jobs that are triggered by external events.
- `event(some_event)`: Indicates an event condition.

**Instructions:**

- **Disable "Match Case"** and **Enable Regex Search** as above.

**Example Matches:**

- `condition: event(file_arrival)`
- `condition: event(user_trigger)`

---

**c. Detecting Circular Dependencies**

**Note:** Detecting circular dependencies requires analyzing the relationships between jobs, which cannot be fully achieved with regex. However, you can list all dependencies to aid in manual analysis.

```regex
^\s*condition:\s.*\b(\w+)\b.*$
```

**Explanation:**

- Captures job names specified in `condition` attributes.

**Instructions:**

- **Disable "Match Case"** and **Enable Regex Search** as above.
- **Review the captured groups** to map out job dependencies.

---

**d. Finding Jobs Without Dependencies**

```regex
^\s*insert_job:\s*\w+.*$(?:\n(?!\s*(condition:|date_conditions:)).*)*\n\s*command:
```

**Explanation:**

- Matches job definitions that do not specify `condition` or `date_conditions` before the `command` line.

**Instructions:**

- **Enable "Use Regular Expressions"** and ensure multi-line searches are supported.
- **Disable "Match Case"** as above.

**Note:** If multi-line regex is not supported, you may need to manually identify jobs without dependencies.
